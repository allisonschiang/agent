# Viam Agent

A self-updating service that also manages updates for viam-server (as built from RDK.)


###

Development

Setting the environment variable `VIAM_AGENT_DEVMODE=1` will skip the self-location check for the binary, so you can run it directly during development, without installing to /opt/viam.
